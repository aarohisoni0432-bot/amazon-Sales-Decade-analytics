## ⚠️ Important Note About Data Files

The following data folders were **NOT uploaded on GitHub**:

- `data_cleaned`
- `data_cleaned_v2`
- `data_cleaned_v3`
- Raw datasets

### ❗ Reason:
GitHub does **not allow files larger than 100 MB**, and the cleaned datasets were too large to upload.


### 📌 During live evaluation:
If the evaluators want to see **all cleaned dataset versions**, they will be shown directly from Google Drive.
